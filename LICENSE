      REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE WORK OTHERWISE COMPLIES WITH
      THE CONDITIONS STATED IN THIS LICENSE.

   5. SUBMISSION OF CONTRIBUTIONS. UNLESS YOU EXPLICITLY STATE OTHERWISE,
      ANY CONTRIBUTION INTENTIONALLY SUBMITTED FOR INCLUSION IN THE WORK

      WITH LICENSOR REGARDING SUCH CONTRIBUTIONS.

   6. TRADEMARKS. THIS LICENSE DOES NOT GRANT PERMISSION TO USE THE TRADE
      NAMES, TRADEMARKS, SERVICE MARKS, OR PRODUCT NAMES OF THE LICENSOR,

      NEGLIGENT ACTS) OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, SHALL ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE
      LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
      INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER ARISING AS A
      RESULT OF THIS LICENSE OR OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
      WORK (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
      WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL
      OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES), EVEN IF SUCH CONTRIBUTOR
